# Description
Most of us are familiar with seeing URLs like bit.ly or t.co on our Twitter or Facebook feeds. These are examples of shortened URLs, which are a short alias or pointer to a longer page link. For example, I can send you the shortened URL http://bit.ly/SaaYw5 that will forward you to a very long Google URL with search results on how to iron a shirt.

The resultant application consists of a Spring boot application which acts as a endpoint to the Rest calls and an angular application which consumes this rest calls.

Analytics also has been done using Elastic Stack.
